# Wordchain graph problem

My solution to a wordchain graph problem. 
Problem: Find fastest path between two words in the graph. All words in the graph have five letters. 
A word can be chained with another if and only if the last four letters in word x exists in word y.

The sourcefiles contains my own implementation of a graph and breadth first search to find the shortest path between two words.
